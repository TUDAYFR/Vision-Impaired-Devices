# Vision-Impaired-Devices

## Intro
Visually impaired individuals need devices to help them navigate safely and gain more independence. White canes, guide dogs, mobile apps, GPS navigation systems, and proximity sensors can all be useful tools to assist them in navigating safely and gaining independence.

This project have to answer to the next question :
How to recreate a vision for the imperaid peaple with his valid sens ?

To answer this problem we can separate the project in two part on for the on "How to capture the environement around the user." and an another "How to 
transcribe the environment to the user".

In the right a of the image there is the "capture" part and in the left there is the "transcribe to the user" part.

## How to capture the environement around the user ?

I will let my friend explain his work

## How to transcribe the environment to the user ?

As it can be seen on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Au47gnXs0w&t=751s) this device answer clearly to the problem so i challeng me to do it myself

1. The mechanical part

This shows how the first part works. What we have to understand is :
 - if the two motor turn the body will also turn.
 - if the motor 2 turn the body will translate.
 With this you can control the position of all the cams.

Now we have see how the cames are controled, it is time to understant how we can control the state off all the axis.
The proces is to liberate the purple "axis" with the purple cames by turning the "Cames Body" and at the same time translate the "Cames Body" to select the desired cames the GREEN, ORANGE and RED ones to actuate the blue axis.


So now that the idea of the mecanism is fixe i have desined pieces to make these laison.

this body is the cams body where all the cams rotate to actuate all the axis.

and this is all the 9 axis actuator.

And here the full system with the two step motors.

2. The electronical part
